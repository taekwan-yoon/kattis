-------------------------------------------------------
Problem: Hailstone Sequences
-------------------------------------------------------
Description
Given an integer n, its hailstone sequence is constructed in the following way. First, the integer n is itself added as the first number of the sequence. The following procedure is then repeated. If the last integer a added to the sequence is even, we add a/2 to the sequence. If it is odd, we add 3a + 1 to the sequence. Whenever the integer 1 is added to the sequence, the procedure concludes and the sequence generated is the hailstone sequence of n.
-------------------------------------------------------
Input
The input consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^12).
-------------------------------------------------------
Output
Output a single integer â€“ the length of the sequence.
